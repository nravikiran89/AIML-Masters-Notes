- Argue for correctness
- Quantify efficiency
	- Time Complexity
	- Space Complexity

### Time Complexity
- Measure how much time the algorithm takes to reach it's goal
- Running time of the algorithm
- Absolute run time depends on processor speed
### Space Complexity
- How much memory does the algorithm use to run?
- Memory can always be extended by adding more cards

### Asymptotic Analysis
- An algorithm will take different run times on different machines based on their configurations
- It may be different for different inputs
- Focus on system-independent factors
- Leave system-dependent factors to experts.
