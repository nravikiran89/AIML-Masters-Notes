=> If [[8. Sampling and Distribution#Sample|samples]] of size n are drawn randomly from a [[8. Sampling and Distribution#Population|population]] that has a [[1. Measure of Central Tendency#Mean|mean]] of $\mu$ and a standard deviation of $\sigma$, the [[8. Sampling and Distribution#Sampling Variation|sample means]] $\overline{x}$, are approximately [[7. Continuous Probability Distributions#Normal Distribution|normally distributed]] for the sufficiently large sample sizes(n $\ge$ 30) regardless of the shape of the population distribution.

=> If population is normally distributed, sample means are normally distributed for any sample sizes

=> From mathematical expectation: $\mu_{\overline{x}} = \mu$ and $\sigma_{\overline{x}} = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$ 

### Z scores for sample means
=> Following Central Limit Theorem, sample means can be analyzed by using [[7. Continuous Probability Distributions#Standard Normal Distribution|Z scores]]
=> If sample means are normally distributed, the Z score formula applied to sample means would be $$Z = \frac{\overline{X}-\mu_{\overline{X}}}{\sigma_{\overline{X}}}$$
=> The standard deviation of the statistic of interest is $\sigma_{_{\overline{X}}}$, sometimes referred to as the standard error of mean

#### Sampling from a finite population / **FINITE CORRECTION FACTOR**
=> Previous formula for computing Z score is with the assumption of infinite or extremely large population.
=> For finite population, statistical adjustment can be made to the Z formula for sample means.
=> The adjustment is called: **FINITE CORRECTION FACTOR** $\sqrt{\frac{N-n}{N-1}}$
=> Formula for Z score is modified as, $$Z = \frac{\overline{x} - \mu}{\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}\sqrt{\frac{N-n}{N-1}}}$$
=> *As N >> n, finite correction factor approaches 1*
=> *Can be used whenever finite population is encountered*
=> *Rule of thumb: If sample size is less than 5% of the finite population size, $\frac{n}{N} < 0.05$, the finite correction factor **does not** affect the final Z score*

#### Sampling distribution of Sample Proportion
=> If research results in countable items, the sample proportion is often the statistic of choice. $$Sample\ Proportion,\ \quad \hat{p} = \frac{x}{n}$$
where x = number of items in a sample that have the characteristic
      n = number of items in sample

##### Z-Formula for sample proportions
For $np > 15$ and $nq > 15$ $$Z = \frac{\hat{p}-P}{\sqrt{\frac{pq}{n}}}$$
where, 
P = Population proportion
$\hat{p}$ = Sample proportion
q = 1-p
n = Sample size


### Forms of Statistical Inference
#### Point Estimation
* Statistic taken from a sample that is used to estimate a population parameter
* Only as good as the representative sample
* Will vary for different sample sets

| Statistical Measure | Sample Estimates | Population Parameter |
| ------------------- | ---------------- | -------------------- |
| Mean                | $\overline{X}$   | $\mu$                |
| Variance            | $S^2$            | $\sigma^2$           |
| Proportion          | p                | P                    |
| Correlation         | r                | $\rho$               |

#### Interval Estimation
* Point estimate can vary widely with different samples, especially in heterogenous target population and is not a reliable estimate for population mean
* To overcome this, by making use of point estimates, an interval with lower and upper bound for the parameter or difference in parameters can be computed at a certain level of confidence, so that the value of unknown parameter  or difference in parameter are covered within this limit
##### Confidence Interval
* Interval estimate with certain confidence level
* Range of values within which the analyst can declare with some confidence, the population parameter lies
* Computation of 100(1-$\alpha$)% confidence interval is the most common way of finding the interval estimate.
	* $\alpha$ is also called area under curve at one of the tail-end of [[7. Continuous Probability Distributions#Normal Distribution|normal distribution]].
	* $\frac{\alpha}{2}$ is the area under normal curve at both tail ends
* Most commonly used confidence levels close to 1, are 0.95(95%) or 0.99(99%)
##### Role of $\alpha$ in confidence interval
