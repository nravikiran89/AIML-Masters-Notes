### Population
* Aggregate of facts
* Set of all elements of interest for a specific aim or objective
* Process of conducting a survey to collect data for entire population is called census
### Sample
* Subset of population
* **Sample Survey**: Process of conducting a survey to collect data for a sample

### Important Terminologies
*Statistics uses data from a [[#Sample]] to make estimates and test hypothesis about the characteristics of a population in the point of minimizing the resources(Money, Manpower, Material and Time - 3MT). This process of statistics is called Inferential Statistics*

#### Parameter
* Population constants; values generally unknown
	* Population [[1. Measure of Central Tendency#Mean|mean]], $\mu$
	* Population [[2. Measure of Variability#Variance|variance]], $\sigma^2$
	* Population proportion, P
	* Population Correlation Coefficient, $\rho$
	* ..
* Examples:
	* [[6. Discrete Probability Distributions#Binomial Distribution|Binomial distribution]] (n, p)
	* [[6. Discrete Probability Distributions#Poisson Distribution and Rare Events|Poisson distribution]] ($\lambda$)
	* [[7. Continuous Probability Distributions#Normal Distribution|Normal distribution]] ($\mu, \sigma^2$)

### Sampling
* Process of selecting samples from a well defined target populations.
* If representative samples are selected from a well defined target population which are also consistent and accurate, then the estimates obtained from such samples helps in better generalization of the unknown parameters
#### Reasons for sampling
* Population under study may be either unknown or infinite
* Collecting data from such population may not be feasible
* Even if population is countably finite, cost of collect such data may be huge
* Advantages:
	* The sample can save money
	* The sample can save time
	* For given resources, sample can broaden the scope of study

### Methods of Sampling
The data obtained from samples are the observable data

#### Sample Design
##### Probability Sampling
Assures all the units in the population have some [[4. Probability#Probability|probabilities]] known in advance of being chosen in a sample
###### Simple Random Sampling
* Homogenous and finite target [[#Population|population]]
* Selected unit by unit with equal probabilities
###### Systematic Random Sampling
* Sampling frame
	* Listing of [[#Sample|sample]] units from population
* All units must be arranged in a systematic order
* Only the first unit is selected at random from the sample
* Remaining units are selected at a regular interval of $k$ ($k=\frac{N}{n}$)
###### Stratified Random Sampling
* Heterogenous target population
* Divide heterogenous target population into different stratum by ensuring homogeneity within each stratum
* using random sampling within each stratum to collect samples proportional to population size
* Obtain estimates from each stratum and compute an estimate by weighted average
###### Multistage Random Sampling
* Heterogenous target population spread across wide geographical area in the form of clusters
* Select samples at different stages

##### Non-probability Sampling
Samples are collected with no specific probability structure
###### Purposive/Judgement Sampling
* Selection based on some purpose
* Units which are judged are able to serve a specific purpose are only take for the sample
###### Convenience Sampling
* Sample selection based on some defined criteria, convenient to the investigator who collects data
###### Quota Sampling
* Heterogenous target population
* Divide target population into different stratum by ensuring homogeneity within each stratum
* Select samples by fixing the quota based on the convenience of investigator or researcher
###### Snowball Sampling
* Heterogenous target population
* Selection based on recommendation of already selected units for the sample

### Sampling Error
* Occurs when sample is not representative of the population
* Improper sampling techniques used for selecting samples
* Sampling error is proportionate to sampling variation

### Sampling Variation
* Sampling estimates vary from one sample to another forming a random variable.
* Variability decreases as sample size increases
* Samples must be randomly chosen.
* Size of samples must be optimum (neither too large or too small)
* Required optimum sample size is computed based on some statistical procedures like proportion, SD etc.
* Distribution of 
	* Sample estimates $=>$ Sampling distribution
	* Sample means $=>$ Sampling distribution of mean
	* Sample variances $=>$ Sampling distribution of variance

### Sampling Distribution
* The Probability Distribution of a statistic
* Depends on distribution of the population
* Size of sample
* Method of sample selection

#### Sample Distribution of $\overline{x}$
* Distribution of values of the sample mean($\overline{x}$) in repeated samples
* One way to determine
	* Take a population with a particular distribution
	* Randomly select samples of a given size
	* Compute the sample mean
	* Attempt to determine how the means are distributed
* As sample sizes become much larger, the sample mean distribution begins to approach a [[7. Continuous Probability Distributions#Normal Distribution|Normal Distribution]] and the variation among the means decreases.
