### Continuous Random Variable
* A [[5. Random Variables#Continuous Random Variable|continuous random variable(crv)]] can assume any value in a interval or collection of intervals. 
* Probability of a values within the limits $x_1$ to $x_2$ is defined as the area under the curve of the probability distribution function between $x_1$ and $x_2$

### Normal Distribution
* General distribution Also known as Gaussian Distribution.
* A [[#Continuous Random Variable]] X which assumes all possible values in the entire real space, i.e., $-\infty < x < \infty$ 
* Defined by two parameters, mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$ $$\begin{align*}
&f(x; \mu, \sigma^2) = \frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}}e^{-\frac{1}{2}\begin{pmatrix}\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}\end{pmatrix}^2} \\
&where, \\
&-\infty < x < \infty,\ \ -\infty < \mu < \infty, \ \ \sigma > 0
\end{align*}$$

* Changing $\mu$ shifts distribution left or right
* Changing $\sigma$ increases or decreases the spread
* Bell shaped and symmetric about mean
* [[1. Measure of Central Tendency#Mean|Mean]] = [[1. Measure of Central Tendency#Median|Median]] = [[1. Measure of Central Tendency#Mode|Mode]]
* AUC = 1
* Normal curve approaches but never touches the x-axis as x move further away from mean

#### Areas under normal curve
1. $Mean \ \pm$ One [[2. Measure of Variability#Standard Deviations|Standard Deviation]]: Area =  68%
2. $Mean \ \pm$ Two [[2. Measure of Variability#Standard Deviations|Standard Deviation]]: Area =  95%
3. $Mean \ \pm$ Three [[2. Measure of Variability#Standard Deviations|Standard Deviation]]: Area =  99.97%

#### Standard Normal Distribution
* [[#Normal Distribution]] with $\mu=0$ and $\sigma=1$

```
* Normal Distribution can be converted to standard normal distribution by subtracting the mean and dividing by standard deviation
* The Z score is computed by $$Z = \frac{X - \mu}{\sigma}$$

#### Normal Approximation to Binomial Distribution
[[6. Discrete Probability Distributions#Binomial Distribution|Binomial distribution]] can be approximated by the binomial distribution, when it is impractical to use the binomial distribution to find a probability.

*If $np \ge 15$ and $nq\ge15$, then the binomial random variable x is approximately normally distributed with mean $\mu=np$ and standard deviation $\sigma=\sqrt{npq}$*

### T Distribution
* Used in hypothesis testing and confidence intervals when the sample size is small and population standard deviation is unknown.
* symmetric and bell-shaped, similar to [[#Normal Distribution|normal distribution]], but with heavier tails.
* The shape of the distribution depends on the [[2. Measure of Variability#Degrees of freedom|degrees of freedom]]
* Has heavier tails compared to normal distribution
* if $v$ is the degrees of freedom, then for $-\infty < t < \infty$  $$ f(t) = \frac{\Gamma(\frac{v+1}{2})}{\sqrt{v\pi}\Gamma(\frac{v}{2})}(1+\frac{t^2}{v})^{-\frac{v+1}{2}}$$
* Mean, $\mu = 0$
* Variance, $\sigma=\frac{df}{df-2} \ for\ df>2$ $\implies$ variance gets larger with fewer degrees of freedom and approaches 1 as df increases (corresponding to the variance of the normal distribution)

### Chi-square($\chi^2$) distribution
* Used to assess the goodness of the fit between observed data and a model, test independence between variables, or test variance in a population
* If $v$ is the [[2. Measure of Variability#Degrees of freedom|degrees of freedom]] (also known as parameter of distribution), then $$f(x) = \frac{1}{2^{v/2}\Gamma(\frac{v}{2})} x^{\frac{v}{2}-1}e^{-frac{x}{2}}$$
* Not symmetrical, hence not a normal curve
* Varies from 0 to $\infty$
* Depends only on degrees of freedom $v$

### [[#F-Distribution|F-Distribution*]]
* Sampling distribution of the ratio of two sample variances
* If $S_1^2$ and $S_2^2$ are variances with $\sigma_1^2$ and $\sigma_2^2$, then $$F = \frac{S_1^2/\sigma_1^2}{S_2^2/\sigma_2^2}$$ which follows F-distribution with $v_1=n_1-1$ and $v_2=n_2-1$ 




### Notes
#### F-Distribution
The pdf for a random variable $X ~ F(n_1, n_2)$ is given by $$f(x) = \frac{\Gamma{\frac{n_1+n_2}{2}}}{\Gamma(n_1/2)\Gamma(n_2/2)}(\frac{n_1}{n_2})^{n_1/2} x^{\frac{n_1}{2}-1}(1+\frac{n_1}{n_2}x)^{-\frac{n_1+n_2}{2}} \quad \quad ,x>0$$
