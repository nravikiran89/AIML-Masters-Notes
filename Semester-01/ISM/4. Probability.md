### Random Experiment
Any action whose outcome is unknown

### Sample Space
Sample space of a random experiment is a set S that includes all possible outcomes of the experiment

### Event
Set of all outcomes of the experiment

#### Simple Event
Event described by a single characteristic

#### Joint Event
Event described by two or more characteristics

#### Impossible Event
Event with no chance of occurring, probability = 0

#### Certain Event
Event that is sure to occur, probability = 1

### Complement of Event
Complement of event A is defined as all sample points not in A, denoted by $A^C$

### Union of Two Events
* Union of events A and B is the event containing all sample points that are in A or B or both, denoted by $A \cup B$

### Mutually Exclusive Events
* Two events are mutually exclusive if the events have no sample points in common.
* If one event occurs, other cannot

### Dependency of Events
#### Independent
Occurrence of one event has no effect on the probability of occurrence of the other.
#### Dependent
Occurrence of one event gives information about occurrence of the other.

### Probability
* $Classical\ probability, P = \frac{number\ of\ favourable\ outcomes}{Total\ number\ of\ possible\ outcomes}$
* $Empirical\ probaility = \frac{Number\ of\ times\ the\ event\ occurs}{Total\ number\ of\ observations}$

#### Law of large numbers
Over a large number of trials, the empirical probability of an event will approach it's true probability


### Axiomatic approach
* Probability is a number that is assigned to each member of a collection of [[#Event|events]] from a random experiment that satisfies the following properties: If S is a [[#Sample Space]] and E is any event in a random experiment,
	* $P(S) = 1$
	* $0 \le P(E) \le 1$
	* For two events $E_1$ and $E_2$ with $E_1 \cap E_2 = \emptyset$, $$P(E_1 \cup E_2) = P(E_1) + P(E_2)$$

### Axiom: Addition
* [[#Probability]] that an event A or B will occur is given by $$P(A\cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B)$$
* For [[#Mutually Exclusive Events]], rule is simplified to $$P(A\cup B) = P(A) + P(B)$$ 
### Conditional Probability
* Let A and B be two events in sample space.
* Conditional probability that event B occurs given that A has occurred and it is denoted by $$P(B|A) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(A)}$$
* Similarly, $$P(A|B) = \frac{P(A\cap B)}{P(B)}$$
* This can also be written as $$\begin{align*} P(A\cap B) &= P(A)P(B|A) \\ &=P(B)P(A|B)\end{align*}$$
#### Multiplication rule
* Let A, B and C be three events in a sample space S, then $$P(A\cap B\cap C) = P(A)P(B|A)P(C|A\cap B)$$
* In general, $A_1, A_2, ..., A_n$ are events in S, then $$P(A_1\cap A_2\cap ... A_n) = P(A_1)P(A_2|A_1)P(A_3|A_1\cap A_2) ... P(A_n|A_1\cap A_2 \cap... \cap A_{n-1})$$
* For [[#Independent]] events, where A and B have no dependencies on each other, $$\begin{align*} &P(A|B) = \frac{P(A\cap B)}{P(B)} \\ becomes,\quad &P(A) = \frac{P(A\cap B)}{P(B)} \\ or \quad & P(A\cap B) = P(A) \times P(B) \end{align*}$$
### Total Probability
Let $A_1, A_2, ... A_K$ be [[#Mutually Exclusive Events|mutually exclusive]] and exhaustive events. Then for any other event B, $$\begin{align*}P(B) &=P(B|A_1)P(A_1) + P(B|A_2)P(A_2) ... +P(B|A_k)P(A_k) \\
\implies P(B) &= \sum_{i=1}^k P(B|A_i)P(A_i)\end{align*}$$
