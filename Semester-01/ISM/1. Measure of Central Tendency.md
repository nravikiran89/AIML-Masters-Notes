### Mean
* Also referred to as the **arithmetic average**
* Commonly used centre of data
* Sample mean, $\overline{Y} = \frac{\sum Y}{N}$
* Grouped data mean, $\overline{Y}=\frac{\sum fY}{N}$

### Median
* Category or Score with largest frequency

### Mode
* Divides distribution into two equal parts
* Rules to compute
	* If there are odd number of values, median is middle-ranked value
	* If there are even number of values, median is average of two middle-ranked values
