### Range
* Distance between Largest value and smallest value
* For continuous data, $URL\ for\ X_{max}\ -\ LRL\ for\ X_{min}$
* Based on 2 scores - an imprecise and unreliable measure of variability

### Standard Deviations
* Measure of standard or average distance from the mean.
* Describes how close the scores are clustered around the mean
* Mean standard deviation is always zero.
### Variance
* Mean squared deviation of the scores from the mean
* $$Variance = \frac{sum\ of\ squared\ deviations\ (ss)}{number\ of\ scores}$$
* $$ss = \sum(X - \mu)^2$$
### Degrees of freedom
* Number of independent values or quantities that can vary in an analysis without violating any constraints.
* $df = n-1$

### Formulae
* Variance, $$\sigma^2 = \frac{\sum(X-\mu)^2}{n}$$
* Standard deviation, $$\sigma = \sqrt\sigma$$
