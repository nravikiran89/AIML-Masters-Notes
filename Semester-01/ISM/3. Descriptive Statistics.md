[[1. Measure of Central Tendency#Mean|Mean]] and [[2. Measure of Variability#Standard Deviations|standard deviation]] is one of the more commonly used descriptive statistics for characterizing distributions.

### Five Point Summary
Includes 5 items:
1. Minimum
2. Q1 - First quartile, 25% mark
3. [[1. Measure of Central Tendency#Median|Median]] - Second quartile, 50% mark
4. Q3 - Third quartile, 75% mark
5. Maximum

### Interquartile Range
* Measure of variation
* Also known as mid-spread : spread in the middle 50%
* Unaffected by extreme values
* $$Interquartile\ Range = IQR = Q_3 - Q_1$$
* Measured on an ordered array

### Outliers
Lower limit and upper limit of data set are computed with [[#Interquartile Range]]
* $Lower\ Limit = Q_1 - (1.5 \times IQR)$
* $Upper\ Limit = Q_3 + (1.5 \times IQR)$
Data points below and above the limits are treated as outliers.
