### Steps in Machine Learning
=> Involves building a Predictive model that can be used to find a solution for a Problem Statement
###### Step 1
Define the objective of the Problem Statement
###### Step 2
Data Gathering
=> What kind of data is needed?
=> Is the data available?
=> How do I get the data?
###### Step 3
Data Preparation
=> Cleaning, formatting, Sampling, Decomposition, Scaling
###### Step 4
Exploratory Data Analysis
###### Step 5
Building a machine learning model
=> All insights and patterns derived during Data exploration are used to build the machine learning model
=> Split data into training and testing sets
=> Training data will be used to build and analyse the model.
###### Step 6
Model Evaluation and Optimization
=> Model is tested using the testing data for efficiency and accuracy
=> Parameter tuning and cross-validation can be used to improve the performance of the model.
###### Step 7
=> After evaluation and optimization, use model for prediction.
=> Output can be categorical or continuous.
