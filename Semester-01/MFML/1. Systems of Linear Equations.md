### Linear Algebra
- Study of vectors and rules to manipulate them.
- Points in 2D/3D/..
- Any special object that can be added together and multiplied by scalar values to produce another object of the same kind.
- A vector with n-entries => n-dimensional vector $\in \mathbb{R}^n$
### Systems of Linear Equations
- Central part of linear algebra
- Many problems can be formulated as systems of linear equations.
- Tools from linear algebra can be used to solve the system of linear equations.
### Higher Dimensions
- In 2D, each constraint is a line
- In 3D, each constraint in a plane
- In 4D, each constraint is a .. 
- We could have one solution, no solutions or infinite solutions. No other number of solutions is possible.

### Matrix Representation
Consider the following 3-dimensional system of linear equations: $$\begin{align*}a_{11}x_1 +a_{12}x_2+a_{13}x_3 = b_1 \\
a_{21}x_1 +a_{22}x_2+a_{23}x_3 = b_2 \\ 
a_{31}x_1 +a_{32}x_2+a_{33}x_3 = b_3 \end{align*} \tag{1}$$
The above system can be represented as a matrix multiplication multiplication as $$\begin{align*}\begin{bmatrix} a_{11} & a_{12} & a_{13} \\ a_{21} & a_{22} & a_{23} \\ a_{31} & a_{32} & a_{33} \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\ x_2 \\ x_3 \end{bmatrix} &= \begin{bmatrix} b_1 \\ b_2 \\ b_3 \end{bmatrix} \tag{2} \\
A \times x &= b \tag{3} \end{align*}$$ Where A - matrix of coefficients
       x - vector of independent variables
       b - vector of dependent variables.
       
### Finding solutions to a system of linear equations
A full set of solutions for a given system of linear equations consists of two parts:
1. Particular Solution
2. General Solution
