### Linear Algebra
- Study of vectors and rules to manipulate them.
- Points in 2D/3D/..
- Any special object that can be added together and multiplied by scalar values to produce another object of the same kind.
- A vector with n-entries => n-dimensional vector $\in \mathbb{R}^n$
### Systems of Linear Equations
- Central part of linear algebra
- Many problems can be formulated as systems of linear equations.
- Tools from linear algebra can be used to solve the system of linear equations.
### Higher Dimensions
- In 2D, each constraint is a line
- In 3D, each constraint in a plane
- In 4D, each constraint is a .. 
- We could have one solution, no solutions or infinite solutions. No other number of solutions is possible.

### Matrix Representation
Consider the following 3-dimensional system of linear equations: $$\begin{align*}a_{11}x_1 +a_{12}x_2+a_{13}x_3 = b_1 \\
a_{21}x_1 +a_{22}x_2+a_{23}x_3 = b_2 \\ 
a_{31}x_1 +a_{32}x_2+a_{33}x_3 = b_3 \end{align*} \tag{1}$$
The above system can be represented as a matrix multiplication multiplication as $$\begin{align*}\begin{bmatrix} a_{11} & a_{12} & a_{13} \\ a_{21} & a_{22} & a_{23} \\ a_{31} & a_{32} & a_{33} \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\ x_2 \\ x_3 \end{bmatrix} &= \begin{bmatrix} b_1 \\ b_2 \\ b_3 \end{bmatrix} \tag{2} \\ \\ \\
A \times x &= b \tag{3} \end{align*}$$ Where A - matrix of coefficients
       x - vector of independent variables
       b - vector of dependent variables.
       
### Finding solutions to a system of linear equations
A full set of solutions for a given system of linear equations consists of two parts:
1. Particular Solution
2. General Solution

### Examples 
#### 1 - System of Linear Equations
Consider the following system of linear equations: $$\begin{align*}x_1+x_2+x_3&=3\\x_1-x_2+2x_3&=2\\x_2+x_3&=2\end{align*}\tag{4}$$
##### Solution:
- Step 1: Subtract $3^{rd}$ equation from $1^{st}$ equation, to get $x_1=1$.
- Step 2: Substitute $x_1=1$ into equation 2, we get $-x_2+2x_3=1$. Add this to $3^{rd}$ equation, $3x_3=3$ $\implies x_3=1$.
- Step 3: Substitute this into $3rd$ equation, we get $x_2=1$.
- The unique solution to the system of linear equations is $x_1=x_2=x_3=1$.

#### 2 - System of Linear Equations
Consider this following system of linear equations: $$\begin{align*}x_1+x_2+x_3&=3\\x_1-x_2+2x_3&=2\\2x_1+3x_3&=5\end{align*}\tag{4}$$
![[le2.png]]
- Adding first and second equation, gives us the third equation.
- Thus the solution to the linear equations is any tuple $x_1, x_2, x_3$ which satisfies $2x_1+3x_3=5$ and there are infinite solutions.
- From third equation, we get $x_1 = \frac{5}{2} - \frac{3}{2}x_3$
- Subtracting second equation from third we get, $2x_1 - x_3 = 1$, so we can write $x_2 = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{x_3}{2}$
- Both $x_1$ and $x_2$ can be expressed in terms of a ***free variable*** $x_3$. ^free-variables
- Once $x_3$ is fixed, the other two variables can take on specific values - they are known as ***pivot variables***. ^pivot-variables
- [[#^pivot-variables|Pivot Variables]] and [[#^free-variables|Free Variables]] can be identified using gaussian elimination.

### Elementary Transformations
- Take a complex matrix, perform elementary operations and transform into a simple looking matrix.
#### Elementary Operations
- Operations/transformations that ensure that elementary transformations of the original matrix do not change it's solutions.
- Operations include
  1. Exchange of rows
  2. Multiplying a row by a constant $\lambda \in \mathbb{R} \textbackslash  \{0\}$
  3. Adding a row to another row

##### Example for Elementary Transformation
Consider the following system where we seek all solution for some $a \in \mathbb{R}$ $$\begin{align*}
-2x_1 + 4x_2 - 2x_3 -x_4 + 4x_5 &= -3\\
4x_1 - 8x_2 + 3x_3 -3x_4 + x_5 &=2 \\
x_1 - 2x_2 + x_3 - x_4 + x_5 &= 0 \\
x_1 - 2x_2 - 3x_4 + 4x_5 &= a
\end{align*} \tag{5}$$
We can represent them in a compact matrix form as $$
\begin{bmatrix}
-2& 4& -2& -1& 4& |& -3 \\
4& -8& 3& -3& 1& |& 2 \\
1& -2& 1& -1& 1& |& 0 \\
1& -2& 0& -3& 4& |& a
\end{bmatrix}
$$This is called the augmented matrix ^augmented-matrix
Elementary operations are performed on [[#^791284|Augmented Matrices]].

Following row operation are performed sequentially.
1. Phase 1
	1. Swap $R_1\ and\ R_2$
	2. $R_2 = R_2-4R_1$
	3. $R_3=R_3+2R_1$
	4. $R_4=R_4-R_1$
These steps should give us $$
\begin{bmatrix}
1& -2& 1& -1& 1& |& 0 \\
0& 0& -1& 1& -3& |& 2 \\
0& 0& 0& -3& 6& |& -3 \\
0& 0& -1& -2& 3& |& a
\end{bmatrix}
$$
2. Phase 2
	1. $R_4=R_4-R_2-R_3$
Now we get $$
\begin{bmatrix}
1& -2& 1& -1& 1& |& 0 \\
0& 0& -1& 1& -3& |& 2 \\
0& 0& 0& -3& 6& |& -3 \\
0& 0& 0& 0& 0& |& a+1
\end{bmatrix}
$$
3. Phase 3
	1. $R_2=-R_2$
	2. $R_3=\frac{R_3}{3}$
We get $$
\begin{bmatrix}
1& -2& 1& -1& 1& |& 0 \\
0& 0& 1& -1& 3& |& -2 \\
0& 0& 0& -1& 2& |& -1 \\
0& 0& 0& 0& 0& |& a+1
\end{bmatrix}
$$
