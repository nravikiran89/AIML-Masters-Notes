## Groups
=> A Group is a set G and an operation $\otimes: G \times G \rightarrow G$ defined on G. 
=> Then $(G, \otimes)$ is called a group if the following properties hold:
1. Closure of $G$ under $\otimes$ :$\forall x, y \in G, x \otimes y \in G$
2. Associativity: $\forall x,y,z \in G, (x\otimes y)\otimes z = x\otimes (y\otimes z)$
3. Neutral or Identity Element: $\ni e \in G, \forall x \in G, x\otimes e = x$
4. Inverse Element: $\forall x \in G, \ni y\in G, x\otimes y = y \otimes x = e$

#### Abelian Group
=> An abelian group is a group with an additional property $\forall x,y\in G, x\otimes y=y\otimes x$

##### Examples
- $(Z, +)$ => abelian group
- $(N_0, +)$ => Not a group, since there is no inverse element
- $(Z, \cdot)$ => Set of all integers with multiplication operation, identity exists, but inverse doesn't, so not a group.

## Vector Spaces
- Sets that are just like [[#Groups]] in terms of it's properties with respect to an inner operation +, and also has an outer operation $\cdot$ which denotes scalar multiplication.
- Inner operation can be viewed as a form of addition
- Outer operation can be viewed as a form of scaling
- A real-valued vector space is a set $V = (\mathcal{V}, +, \cdot)$ with operations $+, \cdot$ such that $+:\mathcal{V} \times \mathcal{V} \to \mathcal{V}$ and $\cdot : \mathbb{R}\times \mathcal{V} \to \mathcal{V}$ where $(\mathcal{V}, +)$ is an [[#Abelian Group]] and the following properties hold:
	- Distributivity
	- Associativity with respect to outer operation
	- Neutral or identity element with respect to the outer operation.

### Properties of vector spaces
- Distributivity
	- $\forall \lambda \in \mathbb{R}, x, y \in \mathcal{V}, \lambda\cdot(x+y) = \lambda\cdot x + \lambda\cdot y$
	- $\forall\lambda, \psi \in \mathbb{R}, (\lambda + \psi)\cdot x = \lambda\cdot x + \psi\cdot x$ 
- Associativity with respect to outer operation
	- $\forall\lambda\psi\in\mathbb{R},x\in\mathcal{V},\lambda\cdot(\psi\cdot x) = (\lambda\cdot\psi)\cdot x$
- Neutral element with respect to outer operation
	- $\forall x\in \mathcal{V}, 1\cdot x = x$
- The elements $x\in \mathcal{V}$ are called vectors
- The neutral element with respect to $(\mathcal{V}, +)$ is the zero vector $[0,0, \cdots 0]^T$ and the inner operation is called vector addition.

### Vector Subspaces
Let $V = (\mathcal{V}, +, \cdot)$ be a vector space and let $\mathcal{U} \subseteq \mathcal{V},\mathcal{U}\neq\varnothing$. Then, $U = (\mathcal{U}, +, \cdot)$ is called the vector subspace of $V$ if,
- $U$ is a vector space
- Vector space operations $+$ and $\cdot$ are restricted to $\mathcal{U} \times \mathcal{U}$ and $\mathbb{R}\times\mathcal{U}$
- Notation: $U\subseteq V$ => $U$ is a vector subspace of $V$
- $U$ naturally inherits many properties directly from $V$ because they hold $\forall x \in V$ and in particular $\forall x\in U\subseteq V$
- Inherited properties include
	- [[#Abelian Group]] property
	- Associativity
	- Distributivity
	- Neutral Element

#### Gaussian Elimination to check for linear independence
- Practical way to find if a set of vectors are linearly independent or not
- Fill out a matrix with the columns as the vectors.
- Perform [[Row Echelon Form#Gaussian Elimination|gaussian elimination]] to get the [[Row Echelon Form#Row Echelon Form|row echelon form]]
- Pivot columns indicate all the corresponding vectors that are linearly independent
- Non-pivot columns can be expressed as a linear combination of the pivot columns.

### Generating Set
- Consider a vector space $V = (\mathcal{V}, +, \cdot)$ and a set of vectors $\mathcal{A} = \{ x_1, x_2, \cdots x_k \} \subseteq V$ 
- If every vector $v \in V$ can be expressed as a linear combination of the vectors $x_1, x_2, \cdots x_k$, then $\mathcal{A}$ is called the Generating set of $\mathcal{V}$ ^Generating-Set
- Set of all linear combination of the vectors in $\mathcal{A}$ is called as the span of $\mathcal{A}$ ^span
- Notation: $V = span[\mathcal{A}]$

### Basis
- Smallest generating set
- Consider a vector space $V=(\mathcal{V}, +, \cdot)$ and $\mathcal{A}\subseteq \mathcal{V}$
- A generating set $\mathcal{A}\ of\ V$ is called minimal if there is no smaller set $\tilde{\mathcal{A}}$ such that $\tilde{\mathcal{A}} \subset \mathcal{A} \subseteq \mathcal{V}$ that spans $V$
- Every linearly independent generating set of V is minimal and is called a basis of $V$
