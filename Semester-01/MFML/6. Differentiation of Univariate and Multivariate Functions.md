### Differentiation of Univariate Functions
For h > 0, the derivative of f at x is defined as the limit $$\frac{df}{dx} = \underset{h \to 0}{lim}\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h} \tag{1}$$
The derivative of f points in the direction of steepest ascent of f

### Taylor Polynomial
=> Representation of a function f as a finite sum of terms.
=> Terms are determined using derivatives of f evaluated at $x_0$

Definition:
The Taylor polynomial of degree n of f : $\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ at $x_0$ is defined as $$T_n(x)=f(a)+f'(a)(x-a)+\frac{f''(a)}{2!}(x-a)^2+...+\frac{f^{(n)}(a)}{n!}(x-a)^n \tag{2}$$
$$\implies T_n(x) = \sum_{k=0}^{n}f^{(k)}(x_0)\frac{(x-x_0)^k}{k!} \tag{3}$$
Where $f^{(k)}(x_0)$ is the $k^{th}$ derivative of f at $x_0$ which we assume exists

### Taylor Series
Definition: 
The Taylor series of smooth function $f:\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ at $x_0$ is defined as $$\implies T_{\infty}(x) = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty}f^{(k)}(x_0)\frac{(x-x_0)^k}{k!} \tag{4}$$
=> For $x_{0} = 0$, we obtain the Maclaurin Series as a special instance of Taylor Series.
=> A Taylor Series of degree n is an approximation of the function, which does not need to be a polynomial. 
	The Taylor polynomial is similar to f in a neighbourhood around $x_0$.
	Taylor polynomial of degree n is an exact representation of a polynomial f of degree k, where $k \le n$


### Partial Differentiation
=> For a general case where the function f depends on one or more variables $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$, e.g., $f(x) = f(x_1, x_2)$, the generalization of the derivative to functions of several variables is the gradient. 
=> We find the gradient of function f with respect to x by varying one variable at a time and keeping others constant.
=> Gradient is a collection of all these partial derivatives.

#### Gradients
Definition:
For a function $F: \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}, \ x \to f(x), \ x \in \mathbb{R}^n$ of n variables $x_1, x_2, ..., x_n$ we define the *partial derivatives* as 
$$ \begin{align*}
\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_1} &= \underset{h \to 0}{\lim}\frac{f(x_1+h, x_2, ..., x_n) - f(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n)}{h} \\
\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_2} &= \underset{h \to 0}{\lim}\frac{f(x_1, x_2+h, ..., x_n) - f(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n)}{h} \\
&\cdot \\
&\cdot \\
&\cdot \\
\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_n} &= \underset{h \to 0}{\lim}\frac{f(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n+h) - f(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n)}{h}
\end{align*} \tag{5}$$
Collection of all the partial derivatives in a row vector is called the gradient of or Jacobian, $$\triangle_xf = grad\ f = \frac{df}{dx} = \begin{bmatrix}\frac{\partial f(x)}{\partial x_1},\ \frac{\partial f(x)}{\partial x_2},\ ...,\ \frac{\partial f(x)}{\partial x_n} \end{bmatrix} \tag{6}$$
### Chain Rule
Consider a function $F: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ of two variables $x_1, x_2$. Let, $x_1(t)$ and $x_2(t)$ be themselves be functions of t.
To compute gradient of f, with respect to t, we apply the chain rule for multivariate functions as
$$\frac{df}{dt} = \begin{bmatrix} \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_1} && \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_2} \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} \frac{\partial x_1(t)}{\partial t} \\ \frac{\partial x_2(t)}{\partial t} \end{bmatrix} \tag{7}$$
As an extension further, if $x_1$ and $x_2$ are functions of two variables (s, t), the chain rule yields the partial derivative as
$$\frac{df}{dt} = \begin{bmatrix} \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_1} && \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_2} \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} \frac{\partial x_1}{\partial s}\frac{\partial x_1}{\partial t} \\ \frac{\partial x_2}{\partial s}\frac{\partial x_2}{\partial t} \end{bmatrix} \tag{8}$$
### Gradients of Vector-Valued Functions
We discussed until now, partial derivatives and gradients of functions $F:\mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}$ mapping to real numbers.
Now we generalize the concept for the gradient to a vector-valued functions $F:\mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^m$, where $n \ge 1$ and $m > 1$
For a function $F:\mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^m$ and a vector $x = [x_1, x_2, ..., x_n]^T$, corresponding vector of function values is given as $$f(x)=\begin{bmatrix} f_1(x) \\ f_2(x) \\ \cdot \\ \cdot \\ \cdot \\ f_m(x) \end{bmatrix} \in \mathbb{R}^m \tag{9}$$where each $f_i : \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}$
$$=> \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i} = \begin{bmatrix}\frac{\partial f_1}{\partial x_i} \\ \frac{\partial f_2}{\partial x_i} \\ \cdot \\ \cdot \\ \cdot \\ \frac{\partial f_n}{\partial x_i} \end{bmatrix}$$
and since each f is a function of $x_i$'s
$$\implies \frac{df(x)}{dx} = \begin{bmatrix} \frac{\partial f(x)}{\partial x_1} . . . \frac{\partial f(x)}{\partial x_n} \end{bmatrix}$$
$$\implies \implies \frac{df(x)}{dx} = \begin{bmatrix} \frac{\partial f_1(x)}{\partial x_1} . . . \frac{\partial f_1(x)}{\partial x_n} \\ \cdot \\ \cdot \\ \cdot \\ \frac{\partial f_m(x)}{\partial x_1} . . . \frac{\partial f_m(x)}{\partial x_n} \end{bmatrix} \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n} \tag{10}$$
